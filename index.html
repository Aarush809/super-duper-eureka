            Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language and released as a public alpha for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to various platforms and became the best-selling video game of all time, with 200 million copies sold across all platforms and 126 million monthly active users as of 2020.[19]

            In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.

        Herobrine is one of the best known Minecraft Myths. If he is real, it is clearly a Glitch of the older mobs, which was called a Human and looked like The Player we know, or possibly a ghost within the game. He is also a viral creepypasta made by somebody who played one of the alpha versions, Herobrine hasn't been proven to be in any version of Minecraft, though he might be added for later versions.

        Markus Alexej Persson (Swedish: [ˈmǎrːkɵs ˈpæ̌ːʂɔn] (About this soundlisten); born 1 June 1979),[2] better known as Notch, is a Swedish video game programmer and designer. He is best known for creating the sandbox video game Minecraft and for founding the video game company Mojang in 2009.

Persson's principal venture for founding Mojang was Minecraft which gained popularity and support since its tech demo in 2009.[3] Since then, he has gained significant notability within the video game industry, winning multiple awards and establishing relations with the industry's figureheads.[4] He retained his position as the lead designer of Minecraft until the game's official launch in 2011, after which he transferred creative authority to Jens Bergensten.[5] In November 2014, he left Mojang after its acquisition by Microsoft for $2.5 billion.[6] Microsoft eventually dissociated from Persson following controversial comments regarding topics such as race and gender on his Twitter account.[7]
